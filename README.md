# Graduation-Success-Rate-Visualization
## Graph that compares Graduation Success Rate for students-athletes (NCAA Division I) and overall GSR

This graph was performed as a final project for [Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/DAEJPA2SCW9Y) that I'm allowed to use in personal portfolio.

Please note that you might need lastest version of `Matplotlib` for the correct work.
